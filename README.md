## Get Started With Your Own Project

### A new project

Click the above "Open in Gitpod" button to start a new workspace. Once you're ready to push your first code changes, Gitpod will guide you to fork this project so you own it.

### An existing project

To get started with x11vnc on Gitpod, add a [`.gitpod.yml`](./.gitpod.yml) file which contains the configuration to improve the developer experience on Gitpod. To learn more, please see the [Getting Started](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/getting-started) documentation.

## Notes & caveats

* Right click on the black desktop to open the program launcher/start menu.
* This template uses `quay.io/gitpodified-workspace-images/vnc` instead of `gitpod/workspace-full-vnc` as the workspace image. If you're curious, sources are available at <https://gitlab.com/gitpodify/gitpodified-workspace-images>.
